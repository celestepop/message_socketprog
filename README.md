# Simple Server/Client in C
### By: Celeste Popoca

## Notes
A simple client and server program written in C. 

Note: The libraries are for Linux/Unix systems so it must be run on it to avoid errors. The address needs to be changed to run it properly (currently: "xx.xx.xx.xx"). 

When the client joins the server, the client will be asked to type in a message and the server will return the message with the first letter capitalized. It will ask for a message 5 times and then close the connection.

## My Learning Experience

The hardest part was getting the code to compile and run. As I was learning to create the program in C, I learned that it is best to compile and run it on a Unix/Linux computer. However, I got some pointers on how to do it on a Windows machine, so I attempted to do it on my laptop. Unfortunately, I was unable to figure out how to get it to compile without errors. Eventually, I moved to the online IDE, replit. I got closer to less errors and decided I try doing it on a Unix system. I was able to use the Mac desktops on campus in the library to test it out. This was the only way I was able to do it without getting the crazy errors I got in Windows. The libraries I imported were different and I also got to learn about libraries.
