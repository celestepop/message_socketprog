# Simple Server/Client in C
A simple client and server program written in C. 

Note: The libraries are for Linux/Unix systems so it must be run on it to avoid errors. The address needs to be changed to run it properly (currently: "xx.xx.xx.xx"). 

When the client joins the server, the client will be asked to type in a message and the server will return the message with the first letter capitalized. It will ask for a message 5 times and then close the connection.
